Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: This is where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping it to predict outcomes for unforeseen data.

2. Unsupervised Learning: This type of machine learning algorithm is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.

3. Reinforcement Learning: This is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Applications of machine learning include email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers.
